\chapter{Introduction}
% TODO
The approaches to binary verification detailed in this dissertation%
\index{binary!verification}
are \emph{semi-automated}.
They combine \ac{itp} with automated generation
of at least some components of formal proofs.
This reduces the amount of manual proof effort required by varying degrees
while still providing flexibility in the proving process.

\section{Memory Usage}
The properties targeted for verification in this dissertation
can be grouped into the category of \emph{memory usage}.%
\index{memory!usage}

%TODO: more

As per Rice's theorem~\citep{rice1953classes},
the non-trivial memory usage-related properties presented here are undecidable.%
\index{memory!usage}
This is why the approaches presented in this dissertation
use \iac{itp} environment, allowing user interaction when necessary.

A full discussion of memory usage and the details of how it is handled in this dissertation
can be found in \cref{ch:memory}.
