The approaches to binary verification detailed in this dissertation
\index{binary!verification}
are \emph{semi-automated}.
They combine \ac{itp} with automated generation
of at least some components of formal proofs.
This reduces the amount of manual proof effort required by varying degrees
while still providing flexibility in the proving process.
