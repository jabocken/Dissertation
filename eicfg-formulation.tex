\chapter{EICFG Formulation}\label{ch:eicfg-formulation}

The derivation of \acp{eicfg} from a binary requires four additional things:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a static landing pad table,
    \item an abstract state model,
    \item an abstract transition relation, and
    \item a symbolic execution engine to apply the rules making up our abstract transition relation.
\end{enumerate}
We describe those here.

\todo{maybe describe this as an alternative in the Symbolic Execution chapter? Or tie this into the work from \cref{ch:lattice-lifting,ch:lattice-algorithm}.}
