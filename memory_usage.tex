\section{Definitions}
Much of the memory work in this document relates to the concept of \emph{basic blocks}.
\index{basic block}
A basic block is defined here as a sequence of assembly instructions
whose behavior can be described using only state transitions and branches.
A block always terminates and has no loops.
This definition differs slightly from the definition used by compilers such as LLVM,
in which basic blocks also do not contain any internal branching.
