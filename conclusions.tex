\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusions}
Formal verification of assembly code can produce highly reliable claims over software.
By eliminating the need to trust the compiler
and the semantics of whatever source language the program was written in,
you can drastically decrease the \ac{tcb} in use.
However, assembly-level verification is a fundamentally harder problem
than source code verification.
