Not all components of the dissertation are easily buildable by some TeX GUIs; specifically, the biber-based bibliography and the nomenclature. The included makefile is configured to use `latexmk` to produce PDFs with Synctex enabled, which will repeat generation until all components have stabilized and automatically calls `biber` as necessary. I have also included a local `.latexmkrc` file with the appropriate info to build glossaries and, if necessary, nomenclature.
