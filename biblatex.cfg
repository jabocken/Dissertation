%% To work better with bibs having acm/etc. URLs; those can then use the eprint/eprinttype fields. Also adjusting the hdl and jstor ones to get the textsc/mkbibacro look. This also allows me to use https for some URLs, because the hdl/jstor ones were just http by default! (Not that big of a deal but still nice.) Maybe do this for arxiv too? The arxiv one doesn't seem to be used here though.
