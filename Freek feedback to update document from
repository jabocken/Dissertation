SAFECOMP/CFG chapter:
*** Finally, I would highly recommend explaining every step using a tiny example, something without loops. Provide the 1.) assembly, provide 2.) the output of the angr script (i.e., the cut-points), provide 3.) the invariant, 4.) the regions and 5.) an insight into the proof required to finish the example. This is thus 5 separate paragraphs, each of them taking the reader by the hand. This can be highly similar to what we did in our POPL submission.
^ Would have liked to do this but don't have time

*** Showing results as theorem (theorem environment) for pow2, factorial in CFG chapter is an interesting idea but I couldn't come up with a good way to make it look right in the time remaining.
