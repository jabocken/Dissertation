\section{Introduction}\label{se:cfg_intro}
The first approach for memory usage analysis presented in this dissertation
features a Floyd-style methodology.

This approach focuses on the property of \emph{memory preservation}.

The methodology was applied to several example functions
as well as functions from the HermitCore unikernel library.
