% Motivation
Formal characterization of the memory used by a program is an important basis for security analyses and compositional verification. Proving that it only modifies memory within specified regions, the property of \emph{memory preservation},
is an important aspect of that. However, accurately proving memory preservation, however,
requires multiple 

% First contribution
I first present a control-flow-driven verification approach with mostly manual invariant specification at automatically-selected cutpoints 

% Second contribution

% Proposed future work




Knowledge of the memory used by a program provides a basis 
This dissertation presents the properties of \emph{memory usage} and \emph{memory preservation} and the verification methods used to prove memory preservation over compiled programs.
