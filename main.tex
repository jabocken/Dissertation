% This template is designed to operate with XeLaTeX.
%
% All elements in the Title, Abstract, and Keywords MUST be formatted as text and NOT as math.
%
% Further instructions for using this template are embedded in the document. Additionally, there are comments at the end of the file that give suggestions on writing your thesis.
%
% In addition to the standard formatting options, the following options are defined for the VTthesis class: proposal, prelim, doublespace, draft.

% no pageskip is technically the "correct" style for book printing/two-page reading but adds unnecessary pages when viewing one at a time.
