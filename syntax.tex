\chapter{Syntax-Driven Verification} % compare to CFG-driven
\section{Introduction}
While the methodology presented in the previous chapter works well, it is not ideal.
The need to manually formulate regions
and the amount of work required for developing invariants reduces potential scalability.

To build on the work from the previous chapter,
this chapter introduces the concept of \emph{\acp{fmuc}}
\index{certificate}
generated by untrusted, informal tools.
%TODO

Once loaded into a theorem prover,
minimal user input is required for discharging \iac{fmuc}'s lemmas and theorems
via the proof ingredients and customized proof strategies.
\index{proof!ingredient}
\index{proof!strategy}

After going into further detail on \acp{fmuc} in \cref{se:fmuc_gen,se:fmuc_ver},
\cref{se:syntax_example} provides an example to illustrate the generation
and verification process.
On its own, that example could theoretically overwrite its own return address
due to its pointer arguments, causing \ac{cfi} issues.
The associated \ac{fmuc} provides preconditions to prevent such cases
along with a formal proof of return address preservation under those conditions. 

Following the simple example is a full case study
on the Xen hypervisor~\citep{chisnall2008definitive} in \cref{se:xen}.

\section{Application: Xen Project}\label{se:xen}
The Xen Project~\citep{chisnall2008definitive}
\index{Xen}
is a mature, widely-used \ac{vmm}, also known as a \emph{hypervisor}.
\index{hypervisor}
Hypervisors provide a method of managing multiple
\acp{vm} (called domains in the Xen documentation) on a physical host.
\index{domain}
%Xen has support for hardware-assisted virtualization, referred to as \acp{hvm}. % Relevant because of QEMU

The Xen hypervisor is a suitable case study because of its security relevance
\index{Xen}
and its complex build process involving real production code.
Security is a significant issue in environments where hypervisors are used,
such as the \ac{aec2}, Rackspace Cloud, and many other cloud service providers.
For example, when one or more hosts support guest domains
for any number of distinct users,
ensuring isolation of the domains is important.

The Xen build process produces multiple binaries
that contain functions not present in the Xen source itself.
This is due to the inclusion of external static libraries and programs.
Xen version 4.12 was compiled with \ac{gcc} 8.2 via the standard Xen build process.
This build process uses various optimization levels, ranging from \texttt{O1} to \texttt{O3}.
The version of \texttt{objdump} used to disassemble the compiled binaries
was 2.31.1.
\index{objdump}

The verification effort presented here
covered three of the binaries produced by the Xen build process:
\lstinline|xenstore|, \lstinline|xen-cpuid|, and \lstinline|qemu-img-xen|.
The \lstinline|xenstore| binary is involved in the functionality of
XenStore\fturl{https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XenStore},
a hierarchical data structure shared amongst all Xen domains.
This sharing allows for the possibility of inter-domain communication,
though in general XenStore is intended for simple configuration information.
A smaller program than \lstinline|xenstore|, \lstinline|xen-cpuid|
provides functionality similar to that of the
\lstinline|cpuid| utility\fturl{https://linux.die.net/man/1/cpuid}.
This utility queries the underlying processors
and displays information about the features they support.
Such functionality is important for Xen
as it supports migrating domains
between processors with different variants of the same \ac{isa}~\citep{cpuid-masking}.
The third binary used, \lstinline|qemu-img-xen|,
consists of over three hundred functions
that are not present in the Xen source code.
It provides some of the functionality of \ac{qemu}.
\Ac{qemu} is a free, open-source emulator\fturl{https://www.qemu.org/}.
\index{emulator}
Xen uses it to emulate \acp{dm}, which provide interfaces for hardware storage.

This methodology is currently capable of dealing with \xenpercentage\
of the functions present in the aforementioned binaries (see \cref{fig:unverified}).
The supported features include (nested) loops,
subcalls, variable argument lists, jumps into other function bodies,
string instructions with the \texttt{rep} prefix, and \ac{simd} instructions.
There is no particular limit on function size.
The average number of instructions per function analyzed is 49.
Some of the functions analyzed have over 300 instructions and over 100 basic blocks.

There are five categories of features not currently supported.
The first and most common is \emph{indirection}, accounting for \SI{19}{\percent}.
\index{indirection}
Indirection involves a call or jump instruction
that loads the target address from a register or memory location
rather than using a static value.
Switch statements and certain uses of \texttt{goto}
are the most common causes of indirect jumps.
Indirect calls generally result from usage of function pointers.
For example, the \lstinline|main| functions of all three verified binaries
used switch statements in loops in the process of parsing command line options.
These statements introduced indirect branches.

The second category involves issues related to generating the \acp{mrr}.
This step requires solving linear arithmetic over symbolically computed addresses.
\index{linear arithmetic}
Sometimes, addresses are computed using a combination of arithmetic operators
\index{operator!arithmetic}
with bitwise logical operators.
\index{operator!bitwise}
In some of these cases, our translation to Z3 does not produce an answer.
\index{Z3}
As an example, function \texttt{qcow\_open}
uses the rotate-left function to compute an address.
As another example, function \texttt{AES\_set\_encrypt\_key}
produces addresses that are obtained via combinations of bit-shifting,
bit masking, and \texttt{xor}-ing.
For these cases, separation and enclosure relations cannot be generated.

The instruction \texttt{repz cmps} is currently not supported for technical reasons.
It is the assembly equivalent of the function \texttt{strncmp},
but instead writes its result to a flag.
Various other string-related instructions with the \texttt{rep} prefix are supported,
however.

Functions with \emph{recursion}, a minority in systems code, are also not supported.
Recursive stack frames are not well-suited to automation in this framework.
The two recursive functions encountered both perform file-system-like tasks.
Functions \lstinline|do_chmod| and \lstinline|do_ls| are similar to the permission-setting \lstinline|chmod| utility
and the directory-displaying \lstinline|ls|, respectively.

The final category is functions whose \ac{scf} explodes.
The issue occurs when the pattern in \cref{fig:ex_nonopt} shows up extensively
or when while loops have multiple entries.

\Cref{func-counts} provides an overview of the verification effort.
The table shows the absolute counts of functions verified
as well as the total number of instructions for those functions.
Alongside that information is the number of functions with loops
that were verified and how many manual lines of proof were required in total.
The vast majority of those manual proof lines were related to the loop count.
Meanwhile, a comparison with those functions not verified
can be found in \cref{fig:unverified}.
